# simple_xml_transform
a simple xml transform using lxml and Python

The code in this notebook transforms the trojan horse file to something more regular xmlly. Note that in contrast to the test-2.xsl file it puts the text into elements using trail. I'm not sure whether this was the intention, but still.

Furthermore, this is a very simple approach, as there are no trees available in the source file. Making trees would not be a problem using the tree builder, however.
